Pictionary Counter
This app was a group project, and one of the first we did as a demonstration of a single
page app.

## Motivation
The motivation behind this app was to demonstrate controls being used on a page.

## Build status
Prototypw. This app is not complex, and would require work and styling for production
quality, but it demonstrates a single page app.

## Code Style
HTML5, CSS3, Flexbox, Javascript ES6
